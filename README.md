# Arduino-MQTT-greenhouse-server
MQTT server base on Aruino Uno Wifi for sending climate data
This project contains source files, written on Arduino C.
Main goal of this project is to make MQTT server and website connected to it. 
Settings which i've used on MQTT server panel on Arduino, i will add later.
The main file, which i've downloaded to Arduino's memory i will post here later, because i don't have access to it at the moment.

## Main web-interface

### To make all works you also need to connect Python paho library:
